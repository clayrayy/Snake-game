# Snake
 Simple snake game I made with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.
 
This was a project that was part of a guided tutorial taught by Ania Kubow from Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

I've since gone back and added some basic styling, implemented a board size select feature, and tweaked a few settings to make the game more enjoyable.
